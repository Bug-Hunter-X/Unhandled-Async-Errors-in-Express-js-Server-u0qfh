# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of robust error handling for asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express server with an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) that may throw an error.  However, the error handling is insufficient; it only logs the error to the console, leaving the user with no indication of the problem.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, shows how to implement proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks or `.catch` on promises for a more graceful and user-friendly experience.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` using Node.js (`node bug.js`).
3. Refresh the page multiple times.  Notice that roughly half the time, the server will fail silently, without providing any helpful information to the user.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js` and observe how the improved error handling provides a more informative response to the client.
